This project is a "java2script/SwingJS" project. 
This means that, if you want to, you can create a JavaScript 
alternative to Java. 

Not that you would want to do that. But you could. 

If you DID want to do that, what you would do is to first
copy swingjs/net.sf.j2s.core.jar (the java2script transpiler)
into your eclipse /dropins directory. Then restart Eclipse.

Nothing will happen, because in the .j2s config file in the
root directory we have indicated

j2s.compiler.status=disabled

If you change that to enabled and then do a clean build
(Project...clean...) and then do a <dropdownMenu>Refresh</dropdownMenu>
you should now see a site/ directory that has a few html files in it. 

Then, if you run build-site.xml, that will transfer into the site folder
the (essentially) entire Java Virtual Machine runtime classes in 
JavaScript (made the same way, by the way) into site as well. 

If you then have your machine set up for local AJAX -- see
https://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Jmol_Applet_Deployment_Local -- 
you should be able to start any Java program or applet in src. 

In this particular case, that won't do you a lot of good, because the 
only program here is main/java/com/integratedgraphics/ifs/ExtractorTest.java
and it does a lot of file reading and writing, so it is definitely NOT 
something that you would use JavaScript for. But in the future, we might
create some JavaScript tools that use these classes, and in that case we might
need this java2script/SwingJS business.
