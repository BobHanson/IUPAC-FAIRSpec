Notes by Bob Hanson regarding the processing of
10.14469/hpc/10386

For the most part, the crawling was a straightforward
task, looking for <relatedIdentifiers> that had either 
a URL or DOI relatedIdentifierType. URL types were digital
items; DOI types with relationType="HasPart" were followed
to "child" records.  So, for instance we have:

10386 (the main DOI):
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="DOI" relationType="HasPart">10.14469/hpc/11652</relatedIdentifier>
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="DOI" relationType="HasPart">10.14469/hpc/11349</relatedIdentifier>
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="DOI" relationType="HasPart">10.14469/hpc/11405</relatedIdentifier>

and

11652 (a compound DOI):
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="URL" relationType="HasPart">https://data.hpc.imperial.ac.uk/resolve/?doi=11652&amp;file=1</relatedIdentifier>
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="URL" relationType="HasPart">https://data.hpc.imperial.ac.uk/resolve/?doi=11652&amp;file=2</relatedIdentifier>
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="URL" relationType="HasPart">https://data.hpc.imperial.ac.uk/resolve/?doi=11652&amp;file=3</relatedIdentifier>

Since the DataCite metadata has no more that this information about the URL parts, 
we decided to pull the headers of the files using the HTTPS HEAD method. 
These headers provided mediaType, length, and local filename.

Determination of the spectroscopy type was not definitive. Some of the DOI entries had
<subject subjectScheme="IFD.xxx" where xxx was "IR", "XRAY", or "comp". But "NMR" was not
listed and had to be taken as a default, possibly leading to issues. 

An important aspect of this collection is that each data type subcollection -- NMR, IR, etc. -- has its own DOI:

10.14469/hpc/11359 	Crystal data for Compound 24 Tris((4-(ethoxycarbonyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)oxy)scandium 

and even those are subdivided. So the "NMR Data" object points to:

Notice that this means that all the structure representations found in these deeper
directories (which are all for the same compound) are duplicated in each directory. 
This unnecessary duplication is not too difficult to handle by DOICrawler.java. It is
handled by checking previously created files with the same name and verifying that they
at least have the same file length. Alternatively, we could have downloaded these
digital items and verified that they were identical. 

An additional assumption here is that if two files have the same name prior to the 
extension ("24" or "24-1H" here), then they are representations of the same 
IFD.DataObject.  

An additional note is that the final column in this table -- for example, 
"Image structure representation, V3" -- is not found in the DataCite metadata
and is thus not accessible to DOICrawler.java, as it never sees any of the actual
pages from the repository, only the metadata records backing them, from DataCite.

The proximity of theses files in the same directory allows us to connect stucture with 
spectrum, and the hierarchy of the collection allows to then associate all of these
digital representations with the same compound. 

In addition, in this case, we see that some files have multiple versions. 
DOICrawler.java handles this by always pointing the Finding Aid only the *last* 
entry on the list (v3 in this case) assuming that as corrections are made, 
these corrections are added to the list at the end. 
This assumption may or may not be generally a correct one.

It may be intersting that an unrelated collection at ICL, 

https://doi.org/10.14469/hpc/14443 

(a collection of data for a Ph.D. thesis) is organized in a simpler manner. In this
case, the collection is subdivided into chapters:

Members
10.14469/hpc/14447 	Chapter 5
10.14469/hpc/14446 	Chapter 4
10.14469/hpc/14445 	Chapter 3
10.14469/hpc/14444 	Chapter 2
10.14469/hpc/14489 	VTNA Spreadsheets 

and each chapter has additional subdivisions, by compound:

Members
10.14469/hpc/14449 	4-Chlorophthalazin-1(2H)-one (5.1)
10.14469/hpc/14455 	(1S,2R)-(âˆ’)-2-Bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-ol (5.2)

wherein we find the relevant data:

Again, we have the problem that the description column information is not to be found
in the DataCite metadata (since there is not DOI for each file here, only URLs).
But the advantage here is that there is no duplication of structure representations, 
and the metadata <subjects> contain subjectScheme="inchi" and subjectScheme="inchikey", 
and we can back-translate an InChI to a SMILES and then to a structure within Jmol.

  <subjects>
    <subject subjectScheme="inchi" schemeURI="http://www.inchi-trust.org/">InChI=1S/C8H4NO.Cl.N.H/c1-6-4-2-3-5-7(6)8(9)10;;;/h2-5H;;;</subject>
    <subject subjectScheme="inchikey" schemeURI="http://www.inchi-trust.org/">WTOACRDOVRAYJI-UHFFFAOYSA-N</subject>
  </subjects>

This *would* be perfect. As it turns out, though, this is not the InChI 
of 4-chlorophthalazin-1(2H)-one, as shown in Jmol: 

print "InChI=1S/C8H4NO.Cl.N.H/c1-6-4-2-3-5-7(6)8(9)10;;;/h2-5H;;;".smiles()
[C+1]=C1C2=CC=C[CH+1]1.C2(=[N-1])[O-1]

Yeiks!

The correct InChI, from PubChem gives us a valid SMILES string from Jmol, and turns
that SMILES back into 4-chlorophthalazin-1(2H)-one:

x = "InChI=1S/C8H5ClN2O/c9-7-5-3-1-2-4-6(5)8(12)11-10-7/h1-4H,(H,11,12)".smiles()
print x
c1ccc2c3c1.c2(O)[n][n]c3Cl
load @{"$" + x}
print {*}.find("MF")
H 5 C 8 N 2 O 1 Cl 1
show inchi
InChI=1S/C8H5ClN2O/c9-7-5-3-1-2-4-6(5)8(12)11-10-7/h1-4H,(H,11,12)

So, in this case, the crawler would not know the structure of the compound 
from metadata only.
