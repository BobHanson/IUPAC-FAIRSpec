Notes by Bob Hanson regarding the processing of
10.14469/hpc/10386

For the most part, the crawling was a straightforward
task, looking for <relatedIdentifiers> that had either 
a URL or DOI relatedIdentifierType. URL types were digital
items; DOI types with relationType="HasPart" were followed
to "child" records.  So, for instance we have:

10386 (the main DOI):
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="DOI" relationType="HasPart">10.14469/hpc/11652</relatedIdentifier>
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="DOI" relationType="HasPart">10.14469/hpc/11349</relatedIdentifier>
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="DOI" relationType="HasPart">10.14469/hpc/11405</relatedIdentifier>

and

11652 (a compound DOI):
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="URL" relationType="HasPart">https://data.hpc.imperial.ac.uk/resolve/?doi=11652&amp;file=1</relatedIdentifier>
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="URL" relationType="HasPart">https://data.hpc.imperial.ac.uk/resolve/?doi=11652&amp;file=2</relatedIdentifier>
    <relatedIdentifier relatedIdentifierType="URL" relationType="HasPart">https://data.hpc.imperial.ac.uk/resolve/?doi=11652&amp;file=3</relatedIdentifier>

Since the DataCite metadata has no more that this information about the URL parts, 
we decided to pull the headers of the files using the HTTPS HEAD method. 
These headers provided mediaType, length, and local filename.

Determination of the spectroscopy type was not definitive. Some of the DOI entries had
<subject subjectScheme="IFD.xxx" where xxx was "IR", "XRAY", or "comp". But "NMR" was not
listed and had to be taken as a default, possibly leading to issues. 

Most problematic was that these types were subject designations for *collections* of 
data -- at the DOI level, not the URL level. 

For example, 14469, tells us in its title that it involves NMR and IR prediction and 

  <title>Compound 16: bis(4-(ethoxycarbonyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-olate)magnesium. NMR and IR prediction, G = -2107.704571</title>


  
includes a mix of data types:

Filename	Size	Type	Description
NMR Spectra.mnova 	751KB 	chemical/x-mnova 	NMR Spectrum
NMR Spectra.mnpub 	0 	chemical/x-mnpub 	Mestrenova signature file for NMR Spectra.mnova
IR Spectrum.a2r 	125KB 	application/octet-stream 	IR Spectrum
Mass Spectrum.pdf 	46KB 	application/pdf 	Mass Spectrum
HPLC Scalemic.pdf 	46KB 	application/pdf 	HPLC Scalemic (57:43 er)
HPLC Scalemic Report.pdf 	12KB 	application/pdf 	HPLC Scalemic (57:43 er) Report
HPLC (R,R)-Enantiomer.pdf 	41KB 	application/pdf 	HPLC (R,R)-Enantiomer (>99:1 er)
HPLC (R,R)-Enantiomer Report.pdf 	11KB 	application/pdf 	HPLC (R,R)-Enantiomer (>99:1 er) Report 

Clearly the media type "application/pdf" is not particularly useful here. 

And the <subjects> element for this record includes only:

    <subject subjectScheme="Gibbs_Energy" schemeURI="https://doi.org/10.1351/goldbook.G02629" valueURI="http://gaussian.com/thermo/">-2107.704571</subject>
    <subject subjectScheme="IFD.comp">Gaussian computation</subject>
    <subject subjectScheme="inchi" schemeURI="http://www.inchi-trust.org/">InChI=1S/2C12H12N2O3.2C2H6O.Mg/c2*1-2-17-12(16)10-8-13-14(11(10)15)9-6-4-3-5-7-9;2*1-2-3;/h2*3-8,15H,2H2,1H3;2*3H,2H2,1H3;/q;;;;+2/p-2</subject>
    <subject subjectScheme="inchikey" schemeURI="http://www.inchi-trust.org/">FCXMPNFUGCYHCR-UHFFFAOYSA-L</subject>

despite the fact that we have NMR, IR, MS, and HPLC data.
