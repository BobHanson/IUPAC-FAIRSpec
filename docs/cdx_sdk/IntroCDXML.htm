<h2>The CDXML text-based file format</h2>

<p>A CDXML is a CDX file specially formatted so that it conforms to the <a href="https://www.xml.org/">XML</a>
 specification. We expect that anyone who manipulates a CDXML file will 
be familiar with the general XML specifications, so we present only a 
brief overview here.</p>

<p>A CDXML file has the following general attributes:
</p><ul>
<li>Like a CDXML file, It consists of a fixed header followed by a series of tagged items.</li>
<li>All multi-byte data items are stored as quoted text.  That is, the value equal to 2<sup>8</sup>
 - 1 is stored as the three-byte string "255" rather than as the single 
byte 0xFF or as any other value.  The same value might also be stored as
 "255.0" or "255.00"; any program reading a CDXML file should be 
flexible about data types.</li>
<li>Any amount of whitespace is permitted between objects, and any non-zero amount of whitespace is permitted between properties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Header Format</h3>

<p>The CDX File Header consists of the following string:</p>

<p><tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE CDXML SYSTEM "http://www.camsoft.com/xml/cdxml.dtd"&gt;</tt></p>

<p>The header is then followed by an object tree of tagged items beginning with a document object.</p>

<h3>End</h3>

<p>Since the first object following the header is a document object, the
 end of the file is signified by the end of the document object:</p>

<p><tt>&lt;/CDXML&gt;</tt></p>

<h4><a name="Attributes" href="TableOfProperties.htm">Properties</a></h4>

<p>Properties, also called attributes, are self-contained. A property 
applies to the object which logically contains it. It may also describe 
other objects contained within the object which logically contains the 
property. For example, bond order is a property of a bond, and molecular
 weight is a property of a molecule. Unless otherwise noted, all 
properties are optional.</p>

<p>All properties have a name. Properties are included in a CDXML file 
by listing the property name, an equals sign, and then a quoted string 
representing the property's value.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td><tt>Order="2"</tt></td><td>:</td><td valign="top">The bond with this property is a double bond</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4><a name="Objects" href="AllCDXObjects.htm"><big>Objects</big></a></h4>

<p>Like properties, objects are also self-contained.  Unlike properties, however, objects can contain properties and other objects.</p>

<p>Each object has a name that identifies the type of object.  For 
example, an object that represents a bond has the name "b".  These 
names, like everything else in XML, are case-sensitive.</p><p>

</p><p>The definition of an object starts with a less-than sign, 
followed by the object's name.  Any properties, of present, are listed 
immediately afterward in pairs formatted as <em>propertyname</em>="propertyvalue".  A greater-than sign will appear after the last property.</p>

<p>The definition of an object ends with a less-than sign followed by a 
slash followed by the object name again, followed by a greater-than 
sign. Alternatively, if there are no subobjects, the end-object marker 
may be omitted and replaced by a slash immediately before the first 
closing greater-than sign.</p><p>

</p><p>Any subobjects are listed between those object-begin and object-end markers.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td valign="top"><tt>&lt;b</tt></td><td>:</td><td valign="top">This is a bond</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>id="29"</tt></td><td>:</td><td valign="top">This bond has an ID of 29</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>B="21"</tt></td><td valign="top">:</td><td valign="top">The atom at the first end of this bond has ID 21</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>E="22"</tt></td><td valign="top">:</td><td valign="top">The atom at the first end of this bond has ID 22</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>Order="2"</tt></td><td valign="top">:</td><td valign="top">This bond has a bond order 2.  It is a double bond.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>DoublePosition="Right"</tt></td><td valign="top">:</td><td valign="top">This
 double bond is positioned so that the second line of the double bond is
 to the right of the first, looking from the first atom to the second 
atom</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>/&gt;</tt></td><td valign="top">:</td><td valign="top">There are no more properties or objects associated with this bond</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
