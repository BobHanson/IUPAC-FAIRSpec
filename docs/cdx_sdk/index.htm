This CDX/CDXML documentation was recovered from <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911015950/http://www.cambridgesoft.com/services/documentation/sdk/chemdraw/cdx/index.htm>
a 2019 record on the wayback machine</a> and related waybackMachine records. 

The key information is here, but a few images relating 
to examples were not available from the archive.

To improve performance, the HTML has been modified to make references only 
to this set of retrieved files rather than to the archive itself.

The statement from Revvity Signals about this specification can be found

<h1><i>CDX File Format</i></h1>

<p><strong>CDX</strong>  (ChemDraw Exchange) is ChemDraw's native file format, the internal language of ChemDraw. <strong>CDXML</strong> is an XML-compliant version of the same data. Using the documentation provided here, you can parse <strong>CDX</strong> and <strong>CDXML</strong> data in your own application or construct <strong>CDX</strong> and <strong>CDXML</strong> data programmatically.</p>

<p><em>CAUTION</em>: Some of this documentation is forward-looking, and 
may discuss versions of ChemDraw that do not exist yet.  Call it a 
little unbridled optimism on our part.  You are welcome to use the new 
objects and properties -- one of the features of these formats is that 
the addition of new objects/properties doesn't break anything -- but 
they're not going to do you any good until the new version of ChemDraw 
exists.  And they might not do you any good then, either...we reserve 
the right to change things before the new version is released... The 
current version of ChemDraw is always documented on our tech support site.</p>
