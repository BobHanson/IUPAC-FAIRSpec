Note

This CDX/CDXML documentation was recovered from https://web.archive.org/web/20190911015950/http://www.cambridgesoft.com/services/documentation/sdk/chemdraw/cdx/index.htm
and related waybackMachine records of around that time. 

The key information is here, but a few images relating to examples were not available from the archive.

To improve performance, the HTML has been modified to make references only to within this set of files rather than to the archive itself.

The HTML still contains a lot of unused HTML code from the WaybackMachine in its head element.

Unfortunately, there appears to be no single archive that has all the images, and so some of those are missing.
